    This a list of some problems you can encounter while compiling or
using ctwm.


    1 - You have the message when compiling (static libraries) or
	running (dynamic libraries) ctwm :

ld.so: Undefined symbol: __XtInherit

Why : You have a Sun and the mit X11R5 Xlib prior to the patch level 9,
      there is an incompatibility between the Sun loader and the mit X11R5
      libs before patch 9.

What to do : Upgrade you libs to at least patch level 9, or use :
	     -u __XtInherit at link time.


    2 - Sometime you loose icons, you iconify a client with DontIconifyByUnmapping
	and the icon doesn't show up.

Why : You probably have the Sun X11R5 server. I think there is a bug in this
      server, it sends extra UnmapNotify events.

What to do : Try define BUGGY_SUN_SERVER in your Imakefile. There is a workaround
             in ctwm, but it introduces others problems. Or use the mit server.


    3 - The stacking order is not correct at all in the Workspace window, and
	you have a HP700 with the HP X11R4 server.

Why : This server is buggy.

What to do : define BUGGY_HP700_SERVER in your Imakefile.


    4 - On SGI boxes, many GL applications don't behave very well with ctwm.
	If an Xpert having a SGI Xserver can have a look at this, I will be
	very pleased.

What to do : Avoid carefully GL tools.
