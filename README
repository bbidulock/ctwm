                                   ----


    CTWM is not yet another window manager for X/Window, it is just a
little variation of twm.

    It adds the hability to use and manage up to  32 virtual screens.
You swap from one to another by clicking on a button in a panel.
    You can  custom each  screens by  choosing  different colors  and
bitmaps for the buttons and background root windows.

    The sources files  are just the twm ones plus two : workmgr.[ch].
workmgr.[ch]  were built from scratch,  but the twm ones are slightly
modified.  I tried to  minimize  the  modifications,  and it is  even
possible  (but not sure)  that certain  future twm  patches could  be
applied to ctwm sources files. But don't rely on this.

    I certainly introduced many bugs with these modifications. So, be
tolerant.

    If you are happy with ctwm,  or find severe bugs,  send me a note
