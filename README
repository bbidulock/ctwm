                                   ----


    CTWM is not yet another window manager for X/Window, it is just a
little variation of twm.

    It adds the  ability to use and manage up to  32 virtual screens.
You swap from one to another by clicking on a button in a panel.
    You can  custom each  screens by  choosing  different colors  and
bitmaps for the buttons and background root windows.

    The sources files  are just the twm ones plus two : workmgr.[ch].
workmgr.[ch]  were built from scratch,  but the twm ones are slightly
modified.  I tried to  minimize  the  modifications,  and it is  even
possible  (but not sure)  that certain  future twm  patches could  be
applied to ctwm sources files. But don't rely on this.

    I certainly introduced many bugs with these modifications. So, be
tolerant.

    If you are happy with ctwm, or find bugs, send me a note to :

            lecom@sic.epfl.ch


    Installation :

funny prompt> xmkmf
funny prompt> make

   If you don't have xpm, fetch it from export.lcs.mit.edu or comment
out the #define XPM in Imakefile. Also, if you don't have/want to use
the IMCONV package  (from the San Diego Supercomputer Center) comment
out the #define IMCONV line in Imakefile.

    There is a man,  but not quite complete  (any volunteer ?).  Many
useful informations are only in the CHANGES file, so, read it.

    There is a  mailing list :  ctwm@cognac.epfl.ch,  subscribe  at :
ctwm-request@cognac.epfl.ch.
