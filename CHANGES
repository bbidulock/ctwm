    Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1
    -------------------------------


    1 - Correction of a few bugs

    2 - Add the OpaqueResize flag : similar to OpaqueMove, but redraw the window
        you are resizing at each motion event. Extremely resource demanding, but
        beautiful with fast server/client/network.

    3 - Now if you don't specify any background/foreground/pixmap indication
        for the root window, ctwm leave it alone so you can have your own root
        background pixmap.

    4 - You can now specify on the command line a list of workspaces in which
        a new client opens. The syntaxe is :

          whatever_client -xrm 'ctwm.workspace: name1 name2 ... namen'
   or     whatever_client -xrm 'ctwm.workspace: all'

   where 'name1', 'name2', ..., 'namen' are names of workspaces
    and 'all' refers to all workspaces.

    example : 

         xload -xrm 'ctwm.workspace : all'

    5 - Add the OccupyAll command in .ctwmrc, you can now specify at startup
        a list of windows that occupy all the workspaces.

    example :

OccupyAll {
    "xload"
    "xconsole"
    "xbiff"
}

    6 - Add the f.gotoworkspace function. It goes the workspace specified by
        its name.

    example :

"F1"      =    : root           : f.gotoworkspace "cognac"


    Changes from version 1.1 to 1.2
    -------------------------------


    1 - you can now directly edit workspace names in their buttons.
only printable characters, delete and backspace keys are honored.

    2 - Ctwm now handle shaped colored icons in XPM format. This added
	the variable XPMIconDirectory, and slightly modified the syntax
	of the Icons command. The XPM icon file names should be prefixed
	by the character '@' to distinguished them from the ordinary
	bitmap files.

Example :

XPMIconDirectory  "/usr/lib/X11/X11/XPM"

Icons {
    "Axe"    "@xedit.xpm"
    "xterm"  "@xterm.xpm"
    "xrn"    "@xrn.xpm"
    "HPterm" "@hpterm.xpm"
    "XAlarm" "@datebook.xpm"
    "Xman"   "@xman.xpm"
}

  These above xpm pixmap are given.


    3 - Many bugs fixed :

	- Icon regions now works.
	- the absence of ShowIconManager is taken into account.
	- The -iconic flag is honored.
	- The -xrm 'ctwm.workspace' works as expected.
	- I think that f.warpto[to|ring] works correctly i.e warps.
	  also to the correct workspace if the destination window
	  doesn't occupy the current workspace.
	- A few minor bugs fixed.


    Changes from version 1.2 to 1.3
    -------------------------------


    1 - Many bugs fixed :

	- Partial geometry in the WorkSpaceManagerGeometry statement no longer
	  cause ctwm to core dump.

	- The occupy window name now is "Occupy Window" instead of "Occupy WIndow"
	  a typo on the uppercase I in window.

	- Several types problems that make good compilers to issue warnings.

	- The icons of the WorkSpaceManager and Occupy Window windows now 
	  behave correctly with ButtonPress.

	- UnknownIcon can now have Xpm icons specified.

	- f.showiconmgr no longer map empty icon managers.

	- The ctwm process is smaller (even smaller than twm).


    2 - Add the Occupy command in .ctwmrc, you can now specify at startup
        which window occupy which workspace.

    example :

Occupy {
              "xload"  {"all"}
    Window    "xterm"  {"here" "there" "elsewhere"}
              "xv"     {"images"}
    WorkSpace "images" {"xloadimage"}
}
