    Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1


    1 - Correction of a few bugs

    2 - Add the OpaqueResize flag : similar to OpaqueMove, but redraw the window
        you are resizing at each motion event. Extremely resource demanding, but
        beautiful with fast server/client/network.

    3 - Now if you don't specify any background/foreground/pixmap indication
        for the root window, ctwm leave it alone so you can have your own root
        background pixmap.

    4 - You can now specify on the command line a list of workspaces in which
        a new client opens. The syntaxe is :

          whatever_client -xrm 'ctwm.workspace: name1 name2 ... namen'
   or     whatever_client -xrm 'ctwm.workspace: all'

   where 'name1', 'name2', ..., 'namen' are names of workspaces
    and 'all' refers to all workspaces.

    example : 

         xload -xrm 'ctwm.workspace : all'

    5 - Add the OccupyAll command in .ctwmrc, you can now specify at startup
        a list of windows that occupy all the workspaces.

    example :

OccupyAll {
    "xload"
    "xconsole"
    "xbiff"
}

    6 - Add the f.gotoworkspace function. It goes the workspace specified by
        its name.

    example :

"F1"      =    : root           : f.gotoworkspace "cognac"
